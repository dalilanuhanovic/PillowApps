#About working on the project
In this project, it was important to determine some of the main parts of the page, such as individual images, and work with the text based on the main parts. As for the problem, I would list images that I failed to download and paragraphs that have stars that I failed to center. The project took about 7 days, not very active, so I think I would be able to complete the parts that were not completed in a couple of days.
